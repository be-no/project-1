MVP Goals
As a player, I want to select a spot on the matrix and receive indication that my spot was selected and the number of blackholes that are around the spot so that I can guess the next spot I should select.
As a player, I want to see the number of blackholes on the screen so that I can keep track of all the total blackholes in the game.
As a player, I want to select the choice to restart the game at the end.

Stretch Goals
As a player, I would like a timer so I can see how long it took me to complete one round.
As a player, I would like to select difficulty so I can choose a new matrix that is easier or harder than the current matrix.
